# VS Code Customizations (via JavaScript & CSS)

A practical guide and sample setup for customizing the look and feel of **Visual Studio Code** using CSS and JavaScript with the help of the **Custom CSS and JS Loader** extension.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to personalize your VS Code interface—whether it's themes, icons, or UI tweaks—using custom CSS/JS. It includes example configurations and assets that you can adapt to create a unique editor experience.

## Key Features

* Leverage custom styling through **CSS** and **JavaScript** to alter VS Code’s appearance.
* Easy integration with popular themes and icon packs.
* Step-by-step instructions to use the **Custom CSS and JS Loader** extension.
* Sample files to help you jumpstart your customization efforts.

## Required Extensions

You’ll need to install the following extensions from the VS Code Marketplace:

* **GitHub Theme**
* **JetBrains Icon Theme**
* **Fluent Icons**
* **Custom CSS and JS Loader** ([GitHub][1])

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Install the Required Extensions**
   Get all the extensions listed above from the VS Code marketplace and enable them in your editor.

2. **Prepare Your Custom Files**
   Place your custom `.css` and `.js` files into the `vscode-custom` directory included in this repo, or provide your own styles.

3. **Update Your VS Code Settings**
   Open your `settings.json`, and add configuration like this:

   ```json
   "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
     // Mac or Linux path
     "file:///Users/[your-username]/path/to/vscode-custom/style.css",
     "file:///Users/[your-username]/path/to/vscode-custom/script.js",
     
     // Windows path
     "file:///C:/path/to/vscode-custom/style.css",
     "file:///C:/path/to/vscode-custom/script.js"
   ]
   ```

   **Important:** Always back up your current settings before overwriting them. ([GitHub][1])

4. **Enable Custom Styles & Scripts**
   Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), search for *“Enable Custom CSS and JS”*, and enable it to apply your changes. ([GitHub][1])

5. **Reload as Needed**
   After edits, open the command palette again and choose *“Reload Custom CSS and JS”* to see updates. ([GitHub][1])

## Project File Structure

├── fonts/             # Optional fonts for custom styling
├── images/            # Optional images/icons used in custom CSS/JS
├── vscode-custom/     # Folder for your CSS/JS customization files

## Pro Tips & Considerations

* **Backup First**: Modifying VS Code via external CSS/JS can sometimes lead to UI instability. Always back up your settings before making changes.
* **Keep Style Paths Updated**: Ensure the file paths in your `settings.json` precisely match the location of your `style.css` and `script.js`.
* **Customize with Purpose**: Tweak themes, tweak UI elements, or add functional enhancements—your editor, your rules!
* **Stay Updated**: After VS Code updates, you may need to re-enable the extension to restore your customizations.
